# 🧠 Alphabets of Machine Learning

Welcome to **Alphabets of Machine Learning**!  
Despite what the name may suggest, this isn’t a tutorial repo — it’s a **showcase of 26 Projects**, each housed under a letter from A to Z.  
It Also Consists Projects That are Complete and deployable ,their UI being made in Streamlit.
Every folder represents a unique concept, technique, or application in the field of Machine Learning.

## 📂 What's Inside?

🔡 **A–Z Project Structure**  
Each folder (`a/` to `z/`) contains an ML project — organized alphabetically like an "ABC of ML."

---

### 📚 Topics Covered:

- 🔎 **Supervised Learning**  
- 🧩 **Unsupervised Learning**  
- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning**  
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  

---

### 🌟 Highlight Projects:

- 🤖 **Snake AI using Deep Q-Learning**  
- 🎬 **Movie Recommender System**  
- 📖 **Book Recommendation Engine**  
- 💬 **YouTube Comment Sentiment Analyzer**  
- 📝 **Reinforcement Learning Notes & Experiments**  
- 🧪 **Multi-model Evaluation Pipelines**  
- 🧬 **Word2Vec and other NLP embeddings**

## 💡 Inspiration

Many of the concepts and techniques — from `word2vec` to **combined model evaluation** — are inspired by the work of fellow ML engineers, and open-source repos. This is as much a learning journey as it is a showcase of experimentation.

---

## ⏳ Time & Effort

🛠️ This collection took around **1–2 months** to build, debug, and organize.  
It combines both **personal experiments** to reflect real-world ML practices.

## ❤️ Made with Heart

This project is crafted with passion and curiosity by **Seika**.  
Whether you're here to learn, fork, explore, or just get inspired — I hope you enjoy browsing through the alphabets of ML.
